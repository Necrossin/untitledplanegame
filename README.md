# untitledplanegame
A personal project to check if I am somewhat able to make things in c++. Think of it as of miniature LUFTRAUSERS knock-off.

Made with the use of C++ and SDL 2 library (+ few SDL 2 extentions).

Features things like endless level bounds (on X axis at least), fancy water with reflections and no sounds because I was running out of time.
