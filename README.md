# Untitled Plane Game

A personal project done in under 2 weeks to check if I am somewhat able to make things in C++. 
Think of it as of miniature LUFTRAUSERS knock-off.

Made with the use of C++ and SDL 2 library (+ few SDL 2 extentions).

# Features things like:

- Endless level bounds (on X axis at least)
- Planes/projectiles/clouds generated from text into sprites, because I'm not really a good artist
- Fancy water with reflections

...and no sounds because I was running out of time.

# Controls

- X or Spacebar to shoot
- Arrow keys to steer/accelerate
- Regenerate health when you are not shooting
